# Build the Mini Studio 16 Audio Cap

This is the beginner version. An adult should supervise a child during printing,
wire stripping/crimping, first power and headphone use. Nothing is soldered and
no circuit board is ordered or fabricated.

## What you are making

When closed, the cap has a 3.5 mm line-input hole, one 14-pin plug, and four
small snap windows on its long sides. It plugs directly into the Cardputer.
There is no second power cord: the Cardputer powers it through the 14-pin
plug. The ATOM's physical button and status light are inside the closed lid
in this revision, so pairing and status use the Cardputer commands
(`cap-pair`, `cap-status`) shown in step 8; a button plunger and light window
are planned for enclosure rev-B.

## 1. Buy the parts

Open the human-readable
[`AUDIO_CAP_BOM.md`](AUDIO_CAP_BOM.md) and use the table for your region. It is
generated from the canonical [`hardware/audio-cap/bom.json`](https://github.com/CanadaOrNaw/Mini-Studio-16/blob/agent/v3-alpha-sd-streaming/hardware/audio-cap/bom.json)
and tested to contain exact purchase SKUs for Canada, the United States and the
European Union.

| Qty | Part | The picture must show |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | M5Stack ATOM Lite C008 | white 24 mm square case, USB-C, Grove socket |
| 1 | Rakstore PCM1808 stereo I2S module (exact regional ASIN in BOM) | 3.5 mm jack; installed DOUT/BCK/LRCK/GND pins; USB-C 5 V input |
| 1 | Samtec `TSW-107-08-G-D` header | two rows of seven at 2.54 mm; exact 5.84/5.08 mm posts |
| 1 pack | Adafruit `4635` precrimped leads | 40 male-to-female leads; silicone insulation; **24 AWG** |
| 1 | M5Stack A096 Grove-to-Dupont lead set | factory-made Grove plug and separate Dupont ends |
| 2 | WAGO 221-413 three-port lever splices | genuine clear body/orange levers, three holes each |
| 1 | exact regional 22-AWG USB-C power pigtail from the BOM | male USB-C; red/black bare-wire ends |
| 2 | Essentra `50M020040P006` M2 x 6 nylon screws | module retainers; not lid fasteners |
| 2 | Essentra `04M020040HN` M2 nylon nuts | match the retainer screws |

Do not buy a bare PCM1808 chip, a board with empty header holes, or a module
larger than 50.5 x 30.5 mm. Do not substitute ordinary thin 28-AWG jumpers in
the power splices. Every BOM route names one exact SKU; if a link is out of
stock, search the printed manufacturer part number or ASIN rather than choosing
a look-alike.

## 2. Print the fit gauge first

Download and print:

1. `audio-cap-14pin-fit-gauge.stl`;
2. `audio-cap-base.stl` only after the header fits the gauge;
3. `audio-cap-lid.stl` after the purchased modules sit in the base.

Recommended first pass: PLA, 0.20 mm layers, 0.40 mm nozzle, 3 walls, 20% infill,
no support. The base and lid print flat exactly as downloaded — the lid prints
plate-down with its lip and four snap fingers pointing up, and is flipped over
for assembly. The gauge's one notched corner marks header pin 1 (the `G3`
end); keep that notch in the same corner as pin 1 whenever you test-fit.
Press the exact Samtec header into the small fit gauge by itself—never use the
Cardputer as a hammer. If it needs force, scale only X/Y by 101%, reprint the
gauge and record the result.

The generated models are watertight and have checked bounds. Their real fit is
unverified until the Cardputer and the exact retail module revision arrive.

## 3. Flash before assembly

The step-by-step first-time instructions are in [`FLASHING.md`](FLASHING.md).
Keep the cap parts away from the Cardputer. Connect only the ATOM Lite to your
computer with a normal USB-C data cable. The easiest route flashes the merged
`mini-studio-audio-cap-atom-lite.bin` from the verified Actions artifact at
offset `0x0`. Developers can instead run:

```bash
pio run -e mini-studio-audio-cap-atom-lite -t upload --upload-port PORT
```

Replace `PORT` with the port shown by PlatformIO. The RGB should light and the
serial monitor should print `MS16_AUDIO_CAP_READY`. Unplug the USB-C cable. It
is a programming cable used before assembly; it is not part of the finished cap.

## 4. Make the signal harness

Power must be off. Use the table exactly. Slide the female ends of five
Adafruit 4635 leads onto the rear pins of the 2x7 header, then slide the other
ends onto the named ATOM sockets. Double-check each lead against the table
before moving on — this revision has no keyed holder (planned for rev-B), so
the table and the gauge's pin-1 notch are your orientation references.

| Header position | Connect to |
| --- | --- |
| pin 1 G3 | ATOM G19 |
| pin 3 G4 | ATOM G21 |
| pin 5 G6 | ATOM G22 |
| pin 12 G13 | ATOM G23 |
| pin 13 G5 | ATOM G33 |

Leave header pins 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 completely empty. Pin 2 is `5VIN`,
not cap power. A wrong power pin can damage the devices.

Connect the ADC using factory-crimped leads:

| PCM1808 | ATOM |
| --- | --- |
| DOUT | G25 |
| BCK | G26 (yellow Grove wire) |
| LRCK | G32 (white Grove wire) |
| GND | ground branch below |
| MCLK | leave empty |

## 5. Make the hidden power branch

This step uses **only the 24-AWG Adafruit 4635 leads and the 22-AWG USB-C
pigtail**. Common 28-AWG signal jumpers are not an allowed substitute. An adult
cuts the unused connector off four Adafruit leads—one for header 5 V, one for
header ground, one for ATOM 5 V and one for ATOM ground—and strips 9–11 mm at
the cut end.

Lift every orange lever. Put only straight bare copper under a lever, then close
it and tug gently. No copper should remain visible.

- `+5 V` splice: header pin 6 `5VOUT`, ATOM `5V`, red ADC-power wire.
- `GND` splice: header pin 4 `GND`, ATOM `GND`, black ADC-power wire.

Plug the short ADC-power connector into the PCM1808 module and tuck the entire
branch into its printed channel. Both lever splices and the ADC plug stay inside
the cap. No wire exits the enclosure.

The USB-C pigtail red/black ends are already bare; trim or restrip them to the
same 9–11 mm length if necessary. Never twist 5 V and GND together.

## 6. Check before power

Do these five checks aloud:

- “There is exactly one outside plug: the 14-pin header.”
- “Header pin 2 is empty.”
- “Header pin 6 goes to the +5 V splice.”
- “Header pin 4 goes to the ground splice.”
- “No loose copper can touch another pin.”

Use a multimeter continuity check before first power. `5VOUT` to GND must not
be a short. For the first prototype, place a multimeter in series with the
5VOUT branch and record idle, pairing and connected current. This temporary
bench measurement is removed before closing the finished cap.

## 7. Close and plug in

**Known rev-B gap — read before closing.** With straight precrimped jumpers in
the ATOM's bottom sockets, the ATOM-plus-housing stack is taller than this
revision's interior, so the current base closes over the PCM1808 and harness
but not over a fully jumpered ATOM. Until enclosure rev-B (deeper interior,
retainer bosses, wire channels), bench-test the cap open, or close the lid
with the ATOM resting beside its bay unlidded. Record the measured stack
height of your real parts in `CARDPUTER_TESTING.md` so rev-B uses evidence,
not estimates. The nylon M2 retainers from the BOM are for rev-B.

Seat the PCM1808 jack in its end window. Set the lid on the base — its
locating lip squares it automatically — then press down over each corner until
all four snap fingers click into the side windows. To reopen, press the two
visible nubs on one long side inward through their windows with a plastic
pick and lift; do not pry at the Cardputer.

With the Cardputer off, align the 14-pin plug (the bare header itself is not
keyed — match pin 1 `G3` to the gauge's notched corner and the EXT port's pin-1
end) and push straight in. Never offset it by one pin. Power the Cardputer from its battery or normal USB-C.

## 8. Use it

The line input accepts a stereo 3.5 mm source; start the source volume low.
Mini Studio sums it to mono. Line monitoring defaults off:

```bash
python tools/ministudio_cli.py --port PORT cap-status
python tools/ministudio_cli.py --port PORT cap-monitor 25
python tools/ministudio_cli.py --port PORT cap-pair
```

**First-power acceptance check (do this before anything else):** run
`cap-status` and look for `adc=1`. That single flag is the proof your
PCM1808 module is the required self-clocked master variant. If it stays
`adc=0`, or `cap-monitor` plays audio noticeably at the wrong pitch, the
purchased module is a slave-only or wrong-oscillator variant (PCM1808 needs
an external system clock the ATOM cannot supply — the module must carry its
own oscillator). Stop and exchange the module; no wiring change can fix it.
Record the result in `CARDPUTER_TESTING.md`.

Put one Bluetooth speaker/headset in pairing mode, then run `cap-pair` (the
ATOM's physical button also works whenever the lid is open). The first
discovered audio-rendering device is selected.

| RGB | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| blue | ADC/bridge ready |
| purple | discovering/pair armed |
| green | Bluetooth audio connected |
| red | firmware/I2S/SPI fault |

## 9. First-hardware checklist

Do not call the cap finished until all results are recorded in
`docs/CARDPUTER_TESTING.md`: connector fit, 5VOUT current and sag, heat, silence
noise, line clipping level, left/right polarity, ten-minute CRC/sequence soak,
30-minute Bluetooth output, simultaneous SD recording, battery runtime, pair/
reconnect with three different sinks, and five power cycles.

If anything becomes hot, smells unusual, flickers when audio peaks, or reports
CRC/sequence errors, turn the Cardputer off and reopen the cap. Do not “fix” a
power problem by adding a second power cable; record the failure and revise the
module choice or power budget while preserving the one-plug design.
